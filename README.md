# DraftKings DFS Multi-Lineup Optimizer (NFL)

**Background:** Every day, thousands of Daily Fantasy Sports players try their hand at building the ultimate lineup in hopes of taking home their share of a large cash prize pool - sometimes eclipsing $1M. Daily Fantasy Sports, or DFS, is a variation of traditional fantasy sports games, where players build lineups of professional athletes and earn points based on the athletes' real-life statistical performances. Unlike traditional fantasy sports games, played over the course of an entire season, DFS contests can be as short as a single professional game and rarely last over a week. Players utilizing online platforms, like DraftKings and FanDuel, pay an entry fee for each lineup constructed, with some contests allowing up to 150 lineups per player. Available DFS contests cover a range of different sporting events, and varying entry fees make the games accessible to almost anyone. 

**Problem:** Build a tool to construct 150 unique lineups for the multi-lineup (150) NFL weekly contests offered on DraftKings. Per DraftKings football contest rules, each lineup must consist of 1 quarterback (QB), 2 running backs (RB), 3 wide receivers (WR), 1 tight tnd (TE), 1 flex player (RB/WR/TE), and 1 defense/special teams (DST). DraftKings assigns each player a salary, and the combined salaries of the players in a given lineup cannot exceed $50,000. The popularity of fantasy sports has created a demand for individual score projections, and there are several online resources available to choose from - this project utilizes FantasyPros projections. Potential lineups can be compared using aggregate player projections, with higher projected scores favored over lower ones. This is a variation of the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, with an additional constraint defining the quantity of each position required in a valid lineup. The player projections are their 'value' and the salaries are their 'cost', with the maximum capacity of the 'knapsack' represented by the $50,000 lineup salary cap. The Knapsack Problem is NP-complete and has no known polynomial-time solution, and solving by brute force has a time complexity of O(2^n).
